* morganjbrand@gmail.com


## What was there?

### The relevant not so distant past

## What is there?

### The present and the future

## A tradional approach to the scientific method

1) Devise a fancy question and call it a hypothesis

2) Formulate a means of collecting the relevant data

3) Import data set into statistical software package

4) Run the procedure to get results

5) Copy and paste appropriate pieces from the analysis into document editor

6) Add descriptions

7) Finish/submit report for comments

      **REPEAT** steps 2 - 7 after receiving comments indefinately..


## Disadvantages ot this process

* The process of data capture is not open

* Lots of manual work (prone to make errors)

* Tedious (who likes to carefully copy-and-paste?)

* Likely not recordable (did you write down all the steps you followed to get your analysis?)

* What if you made an error at the beginning of your analysis? If your data had an error? If your hypothesis was biased?

## Why R?
* R is a free software package for statistical analysis and graphics.

* It excels in helping you with:
    + data manipulation
    + automation
    + reproducibility
    + improved accuracy
    + error finding
    + customizability
    + beautiful visualizations
    + Any downsides?

## R vs. RStudio

**R** is an older version that favours the command line programmer

**RStudio** is a powerful user interface that helps you get better control of your analysis.

* Like R, it is also completely free.

* You can write your entire paper/report (text, code, analysis, graphics, etc.) all in a language called R Markdown.

* If you need to update any of your code, R Markdown will automatically update your plots and output of your analysis and will create an updated PDF file.

* No more copy-and-paste!

## What is R Markdown?
* “Literate programming”
* Embed R code in a Markdown document
* Renders textual output along with graphics

## Bookdown with R Markdown

## Bookdown with R Markdown

`Bookdown` is one of the more recent additions to the R-universe. 

Some highlights are:

* Multiple output formats

* Focus on writing the content not typesetting

* Readers can interact with examples

* Feedback and contributions as the book is developed

* Integrates with version control

## Thesisdown with R Markdown
`Thesisdown` is built from bookdown

The current output for the four versions is here:

* PDF
* Word
* ePub
* HTML and Gitbook

## Thesisdown with R Markdown - PDF

## Thesisdown with R Markdown - YAML

## Blogdown with R Markdown

You can now increase your online voice using tools developed in your research methods and present them as a blog!

* The R package `blogdown` allows you to create websites using R Markdown 

The website is generated from R Markdown documents

* all your results
* analysis 
* graphics

can be computed and rendered dynamically from R code to your website!

## What about Git?

## What is Git and Github

**Git** is a version control system that lets you track changes to files over time

* Git manages the evolution of a set of files – called a repository

**Github** is a website for storing your git versioned files remotely

* Github provides a home for your Git-based projects on the internet

* If you are a student you can get the micro account which includes 5 private repositories for free!

## Reproducible Research {#nextsteps .emphasized}
“Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs: Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to humans what we want the computer to do.”

**Donald Knuth, *Literate Programming* (1984)**

## Reproducible Research {#nextsteps .emphasized}
“Reproducible research is the idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them.”

**Roger Peng, Johns Hopkins**
