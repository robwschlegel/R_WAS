# Bananas

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/masheleni.png")
```

On my farm we have a total of 40 hectares of land. Of this 18 hectares is natural forest with 16 hectares of sugar cane and 6 hectares of bananas. Bananas grow throughout the year and from sucker to fruit is approximately 18 months. Under field management practices we are able to maintain three stages of banana trees on each spot thereby decreasing the time to fruit to six month intervals. It is recommended that every 10 years the field is to be replanted to maximize production however, these banana fields have not been replanted recently and it is our intention to investigate what this may mean for the production. 

## Loading the data

I transcribe my raw data into Microsoft Excel from the books. For me this is the easiest way to meticulously enter data and when the data sets are not to large finding errors can be done by changing the sort and filter functions within MS Excel. Once I am ready to import data into RStudio the file is saved as a `.csv` file using the MS Excel drop down option in the save menu. Data are easiest to work with when it is in long format, i.e.. each row represents a single observation. This is not crucial because it can be transformed using R.

```{r load, message=FALSE}
# Load the relevant packages for loading and manipulaiton
library(tidyverse)

# Read in the data using `readr` from the `tidyverse` package
production <- read_csv("data/Banana Production.csv")

# A quick look to make sure the data looks like we expect
head(production)
```

Once the data are loaded and looks like the right stuff I get on to making sure my columns are set as either `date`, `factor`, or `number`. There are multiple ways to do this but I like to use **lubridate** [@R-lubridate] when working with dates and the **Tidyverse** group namely **dplyr** [@R-dplyr] for creating factors.

### Setting date 

```{r, message=FALSE}
# Load lubridate to play with the data values
library(lubridate)

# Making the date coloumn actual date values
production$Date <- as.Date(production$Date, "%m/%d/%y")

# I might want to have the month and year as unique values so I have created floor dates for each
# Add month and year columns
production$month <- floor_date(production$Date, "month")
production$year <- floor_date(production$Date, "year")
```

## Investigating by bunch

### Bunches per month

If we were to try an plot the data for number of bunches harvested per month we can start to see that there is some kind of cyclic trend (Figure \@ref(fig:plota)). On the plot I added a smooth (a model) in blue but there seems to be a problem with what it is doing.

### Working with the data in tidyverse

The fields were recorded as numbers but I would rather have the prefixed by 'f' so that I do not confuse them with production.

```{r}
# I have used the pipe function from the package dply alongside the stringr package to do this
dat <- production %>%
  mutate(Field = stringr::str_replace(Field, "93", "f93"),
         Field = stringr::str_replace(Field, "96", "f96"),
         Field = stringr::str_replace(Field, "101", "f101"),
         Field = stringr::str_replace(Field, "1011", "f1011"),
         Field = stringr::str_replace(Field, "102", "f102"))
```

## Plotting bunches per month

### Bunches per month

If we were to try and plot the data for number of bunches harvested per month we can start to see that there is some kind of cyclic trend (Figure \@ref(fig:plota)). On the plot I added a smooth (a model) in blue but there seems to be a problem with what it is doing. To have a look at what this problem might be I will inspect the data frame and trouble shoot

```{r plota, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Bar graph showing the number of banana bunches harvested per month."}
names(dat)
ggplot(data = dat, aes(x = month, y = Bunches)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", span = 0.2) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "3 month", date_labels = "%b %y") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90, vjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(y = "Banana bunches", x = "Time")
```

#### Problematic smooth

```{r}
# The str function allows you to see both the variable type and the values.
str(dat)

# Open the dat data frame from the environment panel
```

After looking at both the `str` and the data frame the problem is that `Bunches` are not being summed by month. This is an easy fix.

### Bunches per month

If we want to create a summary data set to only include the sum total of banana bunches per month we can simply use `dplyr` and the pipe function. This creates a sum total for bunches.month^-1^ and the blue line now fits the plot more appropriately (Figure \@ref(fig:plotb))

```{r}
names(dat)
# Using dply to group the data by month and year, create a new column for the sum of bunches picked per month, then ungroup
dat.sum_m <- 
  dat %>%
  group_by(month, year) %>%
  summarise(bunches.m = sum(Bunches)) %>%
  ungroup()
```

```{r plotb, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Bar graph showing the sum of banana bunches harvested per month with a smooth fitted in blue."}

# Plotting the data
ggplot(data = dat.sum_m, aes(x = month, y = bunches.m)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", span = 0.2) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "3 month", date_labels = "%b %y") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90, vjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(y = "Banana bunches", x = "Time")
```

From the trend observed in Figure \@ref(fig:plotb) it seems apparent that there may be differences in the monthly output which we could look at. 

```{r}
# I am going to modify an existing dataframe so I will assign it to 'a' as to not back track
 a <- dat.sum_m

# The month and year are going to be pulled out of the date and given their own coloumn
a$y<-year(a$year)
a$m<-month(a$month)

# If I want to use the month as anything other than a date I should tell R it is a factor
a1 <-
  a %>%
  mutate(m = as.factor(m))
```

Now that the data are ready to be looked at as bunches per month a simple box plot can tell a quick visual story 

```{r boplot, fig.cap="Boxplot showing the total banana bunches harvested per month."}
# a quick boxplot for the bunches harvested per month
ggplot(data = a1, aes(x = m, y = bunches.m)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter() +
  labs(y = "Banana bunches", x = "Month")
```

### Statistics

Are the number of bunches harvest per month statistically different?

To answer this we will run a quick one-way ANOVA

```{r}
library(broom)
aov <- aov(bunches.m ~ m, data = a1)

# The tidyed
tidy(aov)
tidy(TukeyHSD(aov))
```

## Investigating by field

```{r}
# Creating a cum for each month grouped by field
names(dat)
dat.sum_m.f <- 
  dat %>%
  group_by(month, year, Field) %>%
  summarise(bunches.m.f = sum(Bunches))
```

As described earlier there are different fields which are picked from. A look at the production of bunches by field in Figure \@ref(fig:plotf) highlights the fact the two fields (f102 and f93) were taken out of production.

```{r plotf, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Bar graph showing the sum of banana bunches harvested per month per field with a smooth fitted in blue."}

ggplot(data = dat.sum_m.f, aes(x = month, y = bunches.m.f)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", span = 0.2) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "12 month", date_labels = "%y") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90, vjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(y = "Banana bunches", x = "Year") +
  facet_wrap(~Field, ncol = 2)
```

### Cumulative bunches per field

It seems interesting to look at a field as a continuous unit and measure the cumulative harvest over time. 

```{r}
# Creating a cumulative bunches harvest for each field
names(dat)
dat.sum_f <- 
  dat %>%
  group_by(Field) %>%
  mutate(cumsum = cumsum(Bunches)) %>%
  ungroup()

```

In Figure \@ref(fig:plot-line) the cumulative number of bunches harvested for each field highlights that they are not all performing the same. We could quickly add a linear model to this to further visualize the trend.

```{r plot-line, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Line graph showing the cumulative harvest for banana bunches per field."}

ggplot(data = dat.sum_f, aes(x = Date, y = cumsum, colour = Field)) +
  geom_line() +
  #geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  #geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  #scale_x_date(date_breaks = "12 month", date_labels = "%y") +
  #theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90, vjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(y = "Banana bunches", x = "Year") 
  #facet_wrap(~Field, ncol = 2)

```

### Cumulative weight per field

It seems interesting to look at a field as a continuous unit and measure the cumulative harvest over time. 

```{r}
# Creating a cumulative bunches harvest for each field
names(dat)
dat.sum_f.w <- 
  dat %>%
  group_by(Field) %>%
  mutate(cumsum = cumsum(weight))
```

```{r plotnormalize,}
names(dat.sum_f.w)
ggplot(data = dat.sum_f.w, aes(x = Date, y = cumsum, colour = Field)) +
  geom_line() +
  #geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  #scale_x_date(date_breaks = "12 month", date_labels = "%y") +
  #theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90, vjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(y = "Weight (kg)", x = "Year") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 400000, 50000)) +
  theme_bw()
  #facet_wrap(~Field, ncol = 2)
```

The awesome thing about this is that you can very easily turn a plot into something more than just a plot using `plotly`

```{r plotly, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#devtools::install_github("ropensci/plotly")
#devtools::install_github("hadley/ggplot2")
library(plotly)

plotly <- ggplot(data = dat.sum_f.w, aes(x = Date, y = cumsum, colour = Field)) +
  geom_line() +
  #geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  #geom_smooth(method = "loess", span = 0.1) +
  #scale_x_date(date_breaks = "12 month", date_labels = "%y") +
  #theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90, vjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(y = "Weight (kg)", x = "Year") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 400000, 50000)) +
  theme_bw()
  #facet_wrap(~field, ncol = 2)

ggplotly(plotly)
```

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
weight.lm <- lm(cumsum ~ Field, data = dat.sum_f.w)
tidy(weight.lm)
```
